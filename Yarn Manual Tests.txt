-----------------
All tests below should be done with at least 3 or 4 connected clients where possible.

Connect/Disconnect -> ensure other connected clients get the correct message and the client connection thread stops on the server.
Send text 		   -> ensure all other clients receive it with the senders username.
Send a PM 		   -> ensure the correct user gets it and the other clients don't.
Server commands    -> -c -n -s : ensure the correct result comes back.
Send file share(s) -> ensure the file is received properly and other client actions don't interfere.
					  perform an accepted fileshare, rejected fileshare, fileshare where the receiving client disconnects during the receive.
					  send a small and large file, check the file is built properly when received based on its extension.
Send voice share(s)-> ensure the recording is received properly and other client actions don't interfere.
					  perform an accepted voice share, rejected voice share, voice share where the receiving client disconnects during the receive.
					  send a small and large recording, check they play fully and properly when received.
Proxy server 	   -> Do all of the above and check that disconnects are being recognised by the server.

When performing the PM and server commands, try to break the system by adding whitespace 
and using the wrong username etc.
When performing file shares have other clients sending text throughout as well as reconnects etc.

NOTE: ALL above tests should be carried out first on localhost and then on the LAN using two or more different laptops.
Different network and application behaviour is typically found between localhost and the LAN e.g. type of Exceptions thrown and network latency.
